% This function removes transitional data. For example, if we have a series
% of feature vectors with class labels:
%
% [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]'
%                      ^                 ^
% The ^ indicates where we have a transition. Data associated with this
% transition, along with the feature vectors before and after the
% transition will be removed (the number before and after are user
% specified)
%
% Inputs
%    data_in: rows of data (e.g. feature vectors)
%    class_in: class labels (column)
%    before: number of rows of data to remove before transitions
%            (default 8)
%    after: number of rows of data to remove after transitions
%            (default same as before)
%
% Outputs
%    data_out: rows of data with transitional data removed
%    class_out: class labels with transitional data removed
